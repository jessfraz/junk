Pure JavaScript Set
===================

Create a set in vanilla javascript with tests using jasmine. I created this just for the purpose of messing around with Jasmine and to show an example of TDD Development.

- ```Set.js``` lives in the src directory and the tests are in the spec directory.
- You can view the tests running [here](http://jfrazelle.github.io/pure-javascript-set/).
